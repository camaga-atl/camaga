          is no greater obstacle to God than time. And not only time but temporalities, 
          not only temporal things but temporal affecting; not only temporal affections 
          but the very taint and smell of time. (Eckhart)</b>

          free from time. Three things prevent a man from knowing God. The first 
          is time, the second is corporeality, the third is multiplicity. That 
          God may come in, these things must go out-except thou have them in a 
          higher, better way: multitude summed up to one in thee. (Eckhart) </font></b>

            who love God for the sake of outward wealth or inward comfort. They 
            do not rightly love God, when they love Him for their own advantage.
