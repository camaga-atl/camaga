          importance, we do not ever seem to experience the present moment. The 
          processing of neural information takes time. If you feel the warmth 
          of the fire with your hand, this perception has to travel from a particular 
          part of your skin along various neural pathways up your arm, through 
          your body, until it finally reaches the brain. Once the information 
          about the temperature has arrived there, it is integrated with various 
          other pieces of information (that may have entered via your sense organs 
          at different times), such as the sight of the flame, or the smell of 
          burning wood. This complex coherent representation involving objects 
          or events and their properties will be the representation of a burning 
          fire. Yet once this information is cognitively available to us, the 
          moment that gave rise to it, and everything that happened during that 
          moment, is already a thing of the past. When trying to connect with 
          the present moment, we face the same situation as someone looking at 
          a distant star, the light of which still reaches his eyes, while the 
          star itself has long ceased to be. The time scale involved here is obviously 
          much shorter, but the fundamental point remains the same." (Jan Westerhoff,
