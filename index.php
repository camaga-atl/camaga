            <h2>2021 Composers Day</h2>
            <p>
            During the year 2020, because of COVID-19, CAMAGA did not hold any in-person concerts or events, with the 
            exception of the Great Composers' Day.  However, this did not deter the Atlanta music community of 
            rasikas and performers from continuing with musical activities.  In keeping with this spirit, in 2021, 
            CAMAGA hosted the annual Great Composers' day. The event was an online, virtual event and unlike in 
            prior years, the event was smaller in duration. The event consisted of singing the five Pancharathna 
            kritis, followed by select Utsava Sampradaya Kritis. Each of these kritis was sung by one of Atlanta 
            area local musician. Camaga thanks all the artists for their participation.
