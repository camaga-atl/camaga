            <h2>2021 Composers Day</h2>
            <p>
            During the year 2020, because of COVID-19, CAMAGA did not hold any in-person concerts or events, with the 
            exception of the Great Composers' Day.  However, this did not deter the Atlanta music community of 
            rasikas and performers from continuing with musical activities.  In keeping with this spirit, in 2021, 
            CAMAGA will host the annual Great Composers' day. The event will be an online, virtual event and unlike in 
            prior years, the event will be much smaller in duration. The event will consist of singing the five 
            Pancharathna kritis followed by select Utsava Sampradaya Kritis. Each of these kritis is being by one 
            of our local musicians. Camaga thanks all the artists for their participation.
            </p> 
            <p>
            You will see a <Watch Live> button that you can click to join, closer to Sat Feb 13 10 AM EST. Please do 
            join, listen to the singing and show your appreciation of our local artists.   
            </p>
