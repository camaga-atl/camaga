                                <p>
                                    In PARIMALA RANGANATHAR,  Muthuswami Dikshitar travels from one holy kshetra to another with his disciples, composing memorable keerthanais on the temple, deity and legend of the place.
                                    The scene begins in Mayuram, where he has just composed “Mayuranatham Anisham” in praise of the Lord there.
                                    He then travels to Indalur, where he composes 2 krithis with the same pallavi but different charanams in Hamir Kalyani. What makes him do it is the focus of the story.
                                    Vocalist Vijay Siva plays the role of Muthuswami Dikshitar.
                                </p>

                                    The second story, SHYAMA KRISHNAN is on Lalitha , the wife of composer Shyama Sastri who waits long hours for her husband to return home from the temple. In a conversation with her neighbour, Dharmambal, the poignancy of her married life with Shyama Sastri is revealed. She ultimately merges with the “naadam” of his tambura , singing the great Yadukula Kambhoji Swarajathi of her husband.
                                    Vocalist Gayathri Venkataraghavan plays the role of Lalitha
                                </p>
                                <h4>KEERTHI VILAASAM</h4>
                                <p>
                                    The third story is KEERTHI VILAASAM, Composer Thyagaraja is preparing for the wedding of his daughter Seethamma, who plies him with a multitude of questions on whether he actually saw Sri Rama, and, if so, why he continues to yearn for Him in every song. Thyagaraja has answers for her, and the scene ends with a revelation of why he uses his Mudra “Thyagaraja” in his compositions.
                                    Vocalist Dr. S. Sunder is Thyagaraja.
                                </p>

                <p>
                    CAMAGA will host a whole-day Carnatic Mela event starting at 10 AM on Sat Apr 7, 2018. The objective of this event is to give our local
                    talent – seniors, juniors, and sub-juniors (in terms of years of learning and experience) – an opportunity to showcase their talents.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Three performers from each category will give a vocal or solo violin concert for about fifteen minutes each and will be accompanied by
                    local young artists. In the senior and sub-senior categories, the young artists will also show their knowledge of manodharma.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The artists were selected based both on their talents and because, in recent years, they were not given a chance to perform on behalf of CAMAGA.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After the end of their performances, the visiting professional musicians -- Carnatica Brothers – Shashikiran and Ganesh and violinist,
                    Sri V.V.S. Murari will give each artist a brief review of their performance and make suggestions.  The purpose is not to do a critical
                    analyses or criticism but to offer an ‘expert’ opinion that would help in the learning process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The agenda for the day include:
                </p>

                <li style="margin-top:10px">
                    CAMAGA has completed twenty years as a music organization.  Following the young artists performances and review,
                    CAMAGA will honor the volunteers who had served and continue to serve this organization with dedication during
                    the last twenty years.  The visiting artists will recognize the volunteers.

                  CAMAGA is pleased to announce that Sri Ganesh, the renowned violinist and vocalist (of the Ganesh and Kumaresh duo) will conduct a music workshop organized by CAMAGA.
                  The workshop will be held for seven consecutive days from June 18 through June 24, 2016 in Atlanta.
               </p>
               <p>
                  This is a great opportunity for teachers, students, and others trained in Carnatic music (either vocal or violin) to learn from a senior musician.
                  We also encourage teachers and those with several years of training in music to register for the workshops to learn more about manodharma and other performing skills.
                  Ganesh would offer voice training, fingering techniques for those with a focus on violin, Manodharma, and more.

                  CAMAGA is organizing a Carnatic Mela.  The event is being organized to celebrate the centenary of Bharat Ratna Smt. M. S. Subbulakshmi, the illustrious musician.
               </p>
               <p>
                  The objective of the Mela is to encourage younger members of the community learning music to participate in enjoyable and yet simple music-related activities
                  (e.g. choir singing, quiz program, debate, and more).  The Mela would also include items that adults can participate (the adults group activities will be independent
                  of the kids’ group activities).  Since the purpose of the Mela is make participation enjoyable and not stressful, the format, unlike a music competition,
                  will have no
                  <emp>winners or losers</emp>
                  .
               </p>
               <p>
                  The event starts at 10 A.M. (with registration starting at 9:30 AM).  The Mela is scheduled for a total of seven hours including an hour of lunch break.  The Mela
                  also includes a concert, Nrithya Katha, and dance.  Carnatica Brothers – Sri Shashikiran and Sri Ganesh would be joined by Upanyasa exponent Smt. Suchitra
                  and Bharatanatyam exponent, Ms. Smitha Madhav.  The concert would be thematic, celebrating the memory of Smt. M. S. Subbulakshmi.  The artists will be accompanied
                  on the violin by B. Raghavendra and on the Mridangam by Thiruvarur Bakthavatsalam.   At the end of the concert, certificates of `appreciation will be awarded by
                  Carnatica to the participants in the Mela.
               </p>
               <p>

               <h4>Saturday April 18, 2015 - 1 pm - 3:30 pm</h4>
               <p>
                  CAMAGA organized a Carnatic Mela program to encourage younger kids learning music to participate
                  in enjoyable and yet simple music-related activities (e.g. choir singing, quiz program, symphony, and more).
                  Since the purpose of the Mela was to make participation enjoyable and not strenuous, it was not similar to a competition.
                  There were no winners or losers.
               </p>
               <p>
                  The Mela was held on April 18, 2015 at the Hindu Temple of Atlanta Auditorium between 1 PM and 3:30PM.
               </p>
               <h4>PROGRAM</h4>
               <h4>Swara Jamming</h4>
               <p>Participantis were given a swara pattern – e.g. s r g p g m (Rupaka) and then he/she created the rest of the Sarali varisai.</p>
               <h4>Raga Repertoire</h4>
               <p>Participants had to identify the raga; sing the arohanam and avarohanam of the raga and a few phrases and lines from a composition</p>

               <h4>Carnatic Quiz</h4>
               <p>
                  This program was a quiz on Carnatic music conducted by the artists.  If no member from a group was able to answer a quiz question, the question was opened to the audience.
                  The quiz tested the basic knowledge on Carnatic music.
               </p>
               <h4>Guess the Kriti</h4>
               <p>
                  Trivandrum N. Sampath played a random line from anywhere inside a kriti on the violin. The participants had to guess the kriti. Some of the kritis were enduku peddala in Sankarabharanam,
                  Bantu reeti in Hamsanadam ....
               </p>
               <h4>Carnatic Choir</h4>
               <p>
                  About 20 students of Jassotha Balasubramaniam performed carnatic kritis in a choir on violin. They were accompanied on mrduangam and ghatam. Here is a youtube
                  video of the performance.
