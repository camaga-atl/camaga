(The Padma Shri is one of India\u2019s civilian honours presented in recognition of distinguished contributions to Indian culture and society.) Her repertoire includes varying classical, semi-classical and folk music forms and genres in several languages. Her music has also provided sound for dance, film and television. By continuously interacting with international musicians, Aruna communicates through music that goes beyond geographic borders, regional contexts and cultural mores. She uses melody as a language of basic and refined human expression."}
