<p>The Carnatic Music Association of Georgia (CAMAGA) organized a
carnatic instrumental (guitar) concert by Shri Prasanna, at the
Hindu Temple of Atlanta at Riverdale, Georgia, on Saturday, March
28, 1998. Shri Prasanna was accompanied on the mridangam by Shri
Poovalur Srinivasan, and on the kanjira by Shri Murali
Ramachandran of Atlanta.</p>

<p>Shri Prasanna commenced the concert with a varnam in ragam
Behag, and concluded with a rendition of the Note popularized by
Madurai Mani Iyer. The other items presented included
Thyagaraja's &quot;Sangeetha Gnanamu&quot; in Dhanyasi, and
&quot;Chakkani rajamargamu&quot; in Karaharapriya, and Papanasam
Sivan's &quot;Kapali&quot; in Mohanam, a composition of Shri G.N.
Balasubramanian in Nalinakanthi, and the popular &quot;Krishna
Nee Begane&quot; in Yamuna Kalyani, and &quot;Enna Thavam
Seithanai&quot; in Kapi.</p>

<p>It seemed to me that Shri Prasanna showed considerable mastery
over the guitar, and was able to coax gamakas out of this western
instrument. I thought his alapanas of Dhanyasi, Karaharapriya,
and Mohanam were handled competently. I also felt that his
expertise in the western music systems like jazz appeared to
influence his renditions of the carnatic compositions, especially
when he played the kalpana swaras, and again when he played the
Note. This was one of the two aspects of this concert that I
found interesting. The other was the significant amount of time
Shri Prasanna devoted to engaging the audience in a
Question-Answer session involving the instrument, his playing,
his exposure to multiple systems of music, etc.</p>

<p>I felt that the percussion support in this concert was of a
very high order. I thought Shri Poovalur Srinivasan adjusted to
Shri Prasanna's playing style admirably. In addition, I felt the
music from the &quot;thoppi&quot; of his mridangam was very good,
and that he played a very nice &quot;tani&quot;. For someone who
was playing his first major professional platform concert, and
who was paired with a very skillful and exuberant mridangist, I
felt Shri Murali on the kanjira rose to the occasion admirably,
and was able to hold his own during the &quot;tani&quot;. </p>

<p>On the whole, I felt this was a different and an interesting
carnatic music recital.</p>
