  <p align="left">About knowledge, Thyagaraja Swami says that it is not worth 
    acquiring knowledge which does not improve the quality of man. A very well 
    read man who has not benefited from his erudition and knowledge is an ass 
    that carries a load of books. Humility and vinaya is essential for spiritual 
    progress.</p>
  <p align="left">About which path to tread for enlightenment, he says that all 
    paths of discipline, humility, love of God and environment lead to salvation. 
    The replacement of the six enemies which haunt us are: desire, hatred, miserliness, 
    attachment to ephemeral values, egotism, and acquisitiveness. The six gunas 
    that we must acquire are: sama or equanimity; dharma or self control; titiksha 
    or willingness to bear suffering; uparati or looking away from evil; sradha 
    or dedication; and samadhana or satisfaction. These six gunas help us attain 
    liberation from bondage. The happiness one person derives from taking one 
    kind of food is no better or worse than the happiness of another person eating 
    another kind of food. </p>
  <p align="left">All schools of philosophy are good, provided the fundamental 
    qualities of genuine love and dedication, compassion and understanding are 
    practiced. This thought is expressed in Anuragamuleni in Saraswathi. In this 
    kriti, Thyagaraja Swami says that you can acquire all the knowledge in the 
    world. But, if an individual does not have bhakthi, he would not develop good 
    qualities. the peIn &quot;Endaro Mahanubhavalu&quot; Swami mentions the different 
    ways of attaining liberation. &quot;Bhagawata, Ramayana, Geethathi, Sruthi 
    Sastra Puranabu mamula Sivadhi Shanmathamula Gootamula Muppadhi Mukkodi Surandarangamula 
    Bhavamula Neriki Bhavaraga Layadhi Sowkyamulche Jiravuyal Kaliki Niravadhi 
    Sugathmulai&quot;. Freely translated, it says that there are several ways 
    to attain knowledge and linberation. By learning the Bhagavatham, Ramayanam, 
    Bhagawath Geetha, the Srutis, and Puranas; by finding out the secrets hidden 
    in the six religions (shanmatha); by finding the inner meaning from the Devas 
    and so on. But, the easiest way to obtain knowledge is bhakthi and sangeetha.</p>
  <p align="left">He explains why he chose Rama Nama as Taraka mantram for japam 
    in his kriti, &quot;Saaramegani Anya Marga Vicharamatike&quot; (Panthuvarali). 
    In this kriti, he refers to Sivas advise to Parvathi (familiar to all those 
    who recite Vishnu Sahasharanamam) that by reciting Rama's name thrice, one 
    may attain the benefit of repeating the hymns a thousand times. In the Thodi 
    kriti, Endu DAginado (Rama! Where are you hiding?), he says, &quot;that it 
    has become the practice and play of the Lord to hide himself before saving 
    his devotees and wonders where he is hiding today to save Thyagaraja. Perhaps, 
    he hid behind the seven trees to help and save Sugriva. Perhaps, he hid himself 
    in an iron pillar to save Prahalada (Prahladhu goraku kambamulo palanundagaledha).</p>
