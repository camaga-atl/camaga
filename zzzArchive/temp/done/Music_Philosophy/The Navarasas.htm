<p align="center"><strong><font color="#6600CC" size="5">Nava Rasas and Proverbs 
  in his compositions</font></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><font color="#FF0000"> P. Sreenivasan and R. Sriram</font></strong></p>
<p><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Emotions: To justify his being hailed 
  as one of the foremost poets of his time, Thyagaraja Swami has brilliantly captured 
  all rasas in his compositions. </b><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Many 
  people think that studying Swami's kritis means only listening to long faced 
  and serious aphorisms and homilies. Few know that he has used Sringara (Romance), 
  Soka<o:p> (Sorrow), Saantha (Tranquil, Peace), and Haasya (Humor)with equal 
  felicity. </o:p></b></p>
<p><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><o:p>Before him and indeed even after 
  his time, Mukhari was used only for the sokha rasa; but Swami proved that this 
  need not be so, by using Mukhari to produce Haasya or humor in the kriti, Chinthisthunaade 
  Yamudu. The description of the dowwarika in the music drama, Prahlada Bhakthi 
  Vijayam, is full of hasya. In the kriti, &quot;Vasudevayani Vedalani&quot; (Kalyani), 
  while describing the entry of the dowarika, he says &quot;Mati Matikini Meesamu 
  duvvi, manmatha roopudu thanani krovvi, dati dati paduchuna&quot; is hilarious. 
  Translated, it shows the ridiculuous behavior of the Dwarapalaka. He is walking 
  here and there, twirling his moustache, posing as if he is Manmata (the God 
  of Love and Beauty), jumping here and there and talking and laughing to himself 
  posing like a handsome guy.</o:p></b></p>
<p><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><o:p>One of the scholars studying the 
  Nowka charithram, responding to the criticism of Thyagaraja by some purists 
  about the excessively sringara rasa ra in this drama, says that Sri Swami has 
  walked the razor edge in keeping strictly in ethical and moral values and his 
  srungara rasa. Unlike Jayadeva, Thyagaraja did not step outside the canons of 
  decency. </o:p></b><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><o:p>Whatever the 
  rasa employed, the ultimate objective is bakthi and rasas have been employed 
  only to emphasis the need for Bhakthi. </o:p></b></p>
<p><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><o:p>Proverbs: Thyagaraja Swami also 
  uses a number of proverbs in his compositions to emphasize the underlying meaning 
  in his compositions. Here are two examples:</o:p></b></p>
<p><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><o:p>1. To test a pot of rice in order 
  to find out if it is well cooked, he cites the familiar proverb in Tamil - &quot;Oru 
  paanai sothukku oru soru padham&quot; - in the Mohanam kriti &quot;Maati Maatiki&quot;. 
  To know my sincerity, Rama, do you need me to plead again and again? Is not 
  one sincere pleading adequate? Do experienced individuals test every rice before 
  finding it is cooked? How many times do I need to plead to you before you would 
  bless me?</o:p></b></p>
<p><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><o:p>2. &quot;Rock the cradle and at 
  the same time pinch the baby.&quot; In the Atana kriti, &quot;Atla Baluguthu&quot;, 
  he says, &quot;Atla baluguthu, nitla baluguthu&quot; &quot;Thotla narbagula 
  Noodhuvu mari mari Thosi natulu killudhuvu Srirama&quot;. You will talk one 
  way and then you will talk the other way. What can I do? You will rock the cradle 
  to make the child sleep and then you will also stealthily pinch the kid.&quot; 
  These lyrics are not only examples of the humor employed by Thyagaraja Swami 
  but also the utter devotion, bhakthi and the personal oneness that shows with 
  his deity, Sri Rama.</o:p></b></p>
<p><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><o:p>3. &quot;In an attempt to make 
  an idol of Ganesha, we end up making the figure of a monkey.&quot; In the Evarito 
  ne delpudu&quot; (Manavagthi&quot;, Thyagaraja Swami says, &quot;Gananadhu Jeya 
  Goraka kaduva narudai dheeraka&quot;; I am constantly doing bhajana in your 
  name and yet I am turning out to be not saved and am ending up as something 
  else. Rama, won't you save me?&quot;</o:p></b></p>
<p><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><o:p>These are a few example of many 
  such proverbs that Thyagaraja Swami uses in his kriti to bring forth his true 
  emotions and purpose behind a composition.</o:p></b><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><o:p></o:p></b></p>
