      <td><p>Sangeetha and bhakthi should be acquired and practiced with humility. 
          Genuine humility brings with it detatchment, suppression or conquest 
          of the baser instincts of Man and, ultimately annihilation of the ego 
          to brring enlightenment. Mere scholarship without humility and music 
          without devotion is according to Thyagaraja Swami, akin to decorating 
          a corpse. In the Sankarabharana kriti, &quot;bhakthi bhiksha meeyavayya,&quot; 
          Swami says that the most well sung song, if sung without devotion is 
          like brocades and diamonds on a dead man. In another kriti, &quot;Samayamu 
          thelisi,&quot; (Asaveri), he draws another comparison - he who misses 
          an opportunity to do good, performs only an act similar to that of an 
          open, but sightless eye. In the Malavsri kriti, &quot;Enallu thirigethi,&quot; 
          he mentions the case of a scholar who, having been invited to lunch 
          by his admirers, neighbours and friends, settled down to a long winded 
          pooja, just to demonstrate his scholarship and erudition, while keeping 
          his hosts waiting.</p>
        <p>The emphasis in our music is humility (Vinaya) and devotion, and the 
          giving up of pride and vanity (&quot;showing off&quot; in common parlance&quot;, 
          ego projection, etc. In the Mukhari composition, &quot;Sarasseruhasana,&quot; 
          he laments that Brahmotsavam has gone in Kaliyuga and that people have 
          taken to neecha karma; they learn the scriptures, not to practice virtues 
          taught by the scriptures but to show off and to make a living out of 
          their learning. The simple path to salvation is forgotten and, little 
          interest is shown towards Truth. For some, their interest is in the 
          relative merits of saguna-nirguna upasana; the secret of the ashta siddhis; 
          the choice among the Shanmathas, etc. Few choose the easy path to moksha 
          or liberation from the cycle of life and death. This is specifically 
          referred to in &quot;nadachi nadachi&quot; (Karaharapriya). In this 
          composition, he refers to the state of Nirvana &quot;puthu chavvu lem 
          thavvu,&quot; the place where there is netiehr birth nor death. In the 
          divyanama keertana &quot;Rama Rama Krishnayanere&quot;, Thyagaraja lists 
          the common weaknesses of men and women and adds that, to get over the 
          consequences of these sins and to avoid committing them again and again, 
          we need to repeat the nama of the Lord. Then, he also tells us why he 
          chose Rama naama for chanting the name of God. It is relevant to mention 
          here that all schools of bhakthi recommend this path.</p>
        <p>We have already seen the dogmatic approach of various mathaas and how 
          Sri Thyagaraja prayed for knowledge or &quot;bedarahita Vedanta&quot; 
          - an approach that can bridge the gulf separting the various schools, 
          with different dogmas. Debate and discussion however erudite, are of 
          no real use if they don't do good to society, as a whole. Naama Sankeerthanam 
          or bahajana which is the basis of the first three forms of &quot;nava 
          vidha bhakthi&quot; mentioned in the Bhagavata, is ideal. In the Kalyani 
          kriti, &quot;Bhajana Seyave&quot;, he asks why debate and discuss endlessly; 
          realize that the body is subject to the goodness of saptaswara, pranava 
          naadha; realize bliss through Rama naama bhajana. After advising in 
          many kritis that namabhajana is the easiest marga, he also tells us 
          why he chose Rama as his chosen deity (Ishta Deiva) and, Rama naama, 
          for parayana.</p>
        <p><u><strong>Rama, the perfect man:</strong></u> The kriti, &quot;manivinaalakincha 
          raa dhate&quot; (Nalinakanti), says that at a time when men were reeling 
          under mere rituals of the Karma Khaanda and wandering directionless 
          in the forest of &quot;bhava,&quot; rama appeared as a man and taught 
          manking, the conduct that will lead to salvation. &quot;Mummoorthulu&quot; 
          (Atana), &quot;Maakelara vicharamu&quot; and &quot;Rama Rama&quot; (Saveri) 
          are compositions close to this theme.</p>
        <p>Here, I may refer to the 5th Prana in the 4th Khanda of the Yajur Veda 
          which contains the sacred Rudram. In Riudram itself, it is namasmarana 
          which is emphasized. The name is stressed in &quot;Namah Sivaya.&quot; 
          It is said that namasamarana confers on the devotee, the &quot;panchaswaroopa 
          gnana.&quot; These are: Parmatma swaroopa gnana, Jeevatma swaroopa gnana, 
          Upaya swaroopa gnana, Purushartha swaroopa gnana and Vidriti swaroopa 
          gnana. In common parlance, this means that a devotee who recites the 
          name regularly and with devotion, will get knowledge of the ultimate 
          and, before that, of the path to it; the obstacles in the way, and, 
          the benefits or fruits of taking that path.</p>
        <p>The Nayanmars too have sung these ideas in their &quot;Devarams;&quot; 
          particularly Appar in his &quot;Aindezhuthu Pathikam&quot; -- Aindezhuthu 
          means fiveletters and they are, na ma si va ya.&quot; Also, Thirumangai 
          Azhwar, in his Thiruvaymozhi has stress this - the Vishnumantram - Namo 
          Narayanaya. Thyagaraja combined these two; the Siva mantra and Madhava 
          mantra, to form the &quot;Rama mantra.&quot; In &quot;evarani nirnayinchira&quot; 
          (Devemrutavarshini), he s ays that the most important letter is nama 
          sivaya is &quot;ma&quot; and the most important letter in Vishnumantra 
          is &quot;ra&quot;. If &quot;ra&quot; and &quot;ma&quot; are removed, 
          both mantras would become meaningless and absurd. So, he combined both 
          these two important jeeva letters to derive the word &quot;Rama.&quot;</p>
        <p>Thus, he created a common plank for namasankeertana for both the Saivite 
          and Vaishnavite schools. In a light-hearted way, he says that his Rama 
          is superior even to the Hindu trinity - Brahma, Vishnu, and Siva as 
          these three Gods, all have some &quot;defect&quot; or other while, his 
          Rama has none: &quot;endunti vedalithiro&quot; (Durbar) lists the weakness 
          of Siva, Vishnu, and Brahma and, praises Rama's virtues (also refer 
          to &quot;emani pogadu thura&quot; (Veera vasantham). To Thyagaraja, 
          Rama is a distinctly superior person: the kritis &quot;eka maata oka 
          bhanamu oka pathni vrathude&quot; (Harikamboji); &quot;Vaadera daivamu 
          manasa&quot; (Pantuvarali) and &quot;Sarmegani anya marga vicharameti 
          ke Oh manasa&quot; (Pantuvarali) etc., he asserts that Rama is the embodiment 
          of virtures and that the Trimurthis worshipped him. Hence, repeating 
          his name in groups, with music, is the surest and most pleasant way 
          to moksha.</p>
        <p>Here, a note of caution in interpreting the Swami's approach and attitude 
          to other gods - the Trinity - is warranted. Scholars say that such comparisons 
          and extolling only Rama may be due to the fact that he might have been 
          somewhat fanatical in his earlier years, like any one of us, lesser 
          people; and , it may also be that in his exhuberant devotion to his 
          chosen Deity, he spoke (rather humourosly) highly one of his Rama. In 
          this conflict, we may also cite kririts such as &quot;Laavanya Rama 
          kanu lara joodave - nee manasu, nee sogasu mee dinusu vere - thaamasa 
          matha daiva mele, etc. (Poorna shadjam). On the other hand, it was at 
          a very later stage of his life that he composed songs like &quot;Paramathmudu 
          velige&quot; (Vagadeeshwari) in which he stresses the immanence and 
          universality of God in everything, the animate and the inanimate, by 
          whatever name we may choose to call Him. To stress this, he explains 
          these further in the charana of the kriti. This kriti is well worth 
          reading several times and understanding fully.</p>
        <p>In the kriti &quot;Ragaratna malikache&quot; (Ritigowla), he says that 
          the Lord will be pleased with the garland of a hundred gems which have 
          been created as the sole means for Thyagaraja's salvation. Thsese gems 
          of compositions have been created from the truths propounded in the 
          scriptures and of the kind that yogis see and experience - Ananda. Many 
          such songs are meant for singing in chrosus by the devotees. Hence, 
          even though elaborately ornamented compositions of the Swami are there 
          for the virtuouso to demonstrate his voice range and quality, and artistic 
          skill, it is the songs composed for goup singing which will elevate 
          the common man higher to planes of divine experience. In &quot;melu 
          melu Rama nama&quot; (Sourashtram), Swami explains the ananada experiences 
          at every level i.e. physical, emotional, intellectural and spiritual, 
          by singing Rama nama.</p>
        <p><em><strong>The last few kritis:</strong></em> It is said that when 
          Swami felt that his mission on earth was completed, he sang the Ganavardini 
          kriti &quot;Daya choochutakidi vela &quot; meaning that it is time for 
          you to take me into you, oh Lord, as I have completed diligently and 
          with devotion, the mission with which you charged me on this planet.&quot; 
          Aftert this, Swami had a vision of Sri Rama with the entourage (Giripainelakonna 
          - Sahana). In this song he says that he surely saw Sri Rama who assured 
          him that he would nbe absorbed in Him in ten days time. Swami then entered 
          snayasarama. When nothing happened as assured by the Lord, on the tenth 
          day, he sang a reminder - the kriti &quot;Parithapamu Kaniyadina&quot; 
          (Manohari).</p>
        <p>Mr. Shyama Rao, one time thasildar of Thiruvayaru, records that after 
          Swami sang this kriti, an Omkara Naadha was heard and a jytoi was seen 
          to emanate from the head of Swami and travelled upward. Swami then slumpted 
          on the thambura he was holding, and become one with the Lord.</p>
