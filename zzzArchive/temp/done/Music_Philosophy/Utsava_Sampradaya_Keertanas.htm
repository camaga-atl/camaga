      <td><p><strong>As the term &quot;Utsava Sampradaya&quot; indicates, these 
          are songs to aid ritualistic worship. In every Hindu temple, a daily 
          program of rituals is followed by singing to the deity; beginning with 
          &quot;waking Him up; for blessing the world; and, ending with letting 
          his rest at night&quot;, after which the temple is closed. Every temple 
          has a &quot;massotsava&quot; or some minor celebration on occassions 
          like Poornima (full moon), pakshotsava or fortnightly festival like 
          Pradhosha and samvatsarotsava or annual festival like the Bharmotsvam 
          and Rathotsavam, etc. In simple by lilting and captivating tunes, the 
          Utsava Sampradaya Keertanas provide &quot;upachara&quot; from &quot;melukolpu&quot; 
          or awakening the Lord (Thirupalli Ezhuchi&quot;; inviting the Lord to 
          come to the Kolumantapa; to ascend the steps to the accompaniment of 
          Veena, &quot;Hetsarika&quot;; to announce that the Lord is in Kolu or 
          Darbar and that all devotees may come and workship - Kalayanam, Nalangu, 
          Oonjal, Aarthi, Pavvali and Melukoluppu. </strong></p>
        <p><strong>Arranged in this natural and proper order and, sung with devotion, 
          these songs can provide a means of elevating oneself to a suprapersonal 
          level: sangeetha and bhaktha have again and again been stressed as the 
          easiest means of salvation, for one who has no time for complex tirualistic 
          worship. Singing all the important upachara songs takes a little over 
          an hour and, if one can do this at least on every Bahula Panchami day 
          or during Pushna nakshatra (the Sain't birth star), he is bound to experience 
          the beneficial results as time goes on.</strong></p></td>
