          <p class=MsoNormal><strong><o:p>Sri Thyagaraja Swami's contribution 
            to music or sangitopasana and the esoteric nadopasana is unique. No 
            other composer has sung about the grammar and mystic significance 
            of sanginta in such terms as Swami has. Arranged in the order of their 
            subject matter, the songs on sangeetha and nada make a textbook on 
            the subject by themselves. He has either created or popularized quite 
            a few ragas which he calls &quot;vintha ragamulu&quot; or new ragas.</o:p></strong></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal><strong><o:p><br>
            </o:p></strong><strong><o:p>Professor Sambamoorthy says that no fewer 
            than 78 ragas owe their identify to Thyagaraja kirtanas. One scholar 
            says that before Swami's time there were so few ragas that all the 
            songs could be classified under a small number of lakshana definitions. 
            In this connection he refers to a lakshana and lakshya work by Sahaji 
            Maharaja, some sixty years before Sri Thyagaraja Swami was born. Sahaji 
            Maharaja lists only 31 ragas which represented practically all the 
            known ragas of that time. It may also be mentioned that there were 
            no songs in Harikamboji or Kharaharapriya before Swami's time. It 
            is not an exaggeration to say that these two ragas were Swami's gift 
            to Carnatic music. Swami has handled some 210 ragas derived from 43 
            melakartas. Also, he did not handle many pratimadyama ragas and this, 
            some scholars claim, is due to the fact that not all Pratimadyama 
            ragas have their individual swaroopa.</o:p></strong></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal><strong><o:p><br>
            </o:p></strong><strong><o:p>Some notable features of Swami's compositions 
            are obvious when he employs a new raga; its arohana and avarohona 
            are indicated in the opening phrase itself e.g. Siddhasena. The kriti 
            in this raga gives the complex arohana and avarohana (derived from 
            the mela Dhenuka, Sa ri ga ri pa ma pa da sa pa ma ri ga ri sa. To 
            cite another example, the opening phrase of the Bahudari kiriti - 
            pa da ni pa ma ga is a marvel for there can be no better opening. 
            Some composers have tried variations without the same melodic effect.</o:p></strong></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal><strong><o:p><br>
            </o:p></strong><strong><o:p>Where two very common and popular ragas 
            are combined in the purvanga or uttaranga, for example in Charukesi 
            or its inverse raga, Kokilapriya, by subtly introducing the note from 
            the poorvanga or uttaranga to give the raga its flavor, the identity 
            of the combination as an artistic form of its own is established. 
            In &quot;Adamodi galada,&quot; the Suddha Daivatam is introduced in 
            the opening phrase and in Dasarathe (Kokilapriya), the kaakonisheda 
            is introduced.</o:p></strong></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal><strong><o:p><br>
            </o:p></strong><strong><o:p>Where a vivadi swara is involved, it will 
            always be found in the opening phrase for if this is not done, the 
            identity of the raga cannot be established. for example, if only the 
            swara from ga ma to ni sa are sung in Nasikabhooshani, only Vachaspathi 
            will be heard. Thus, only if the Shatsruthi rishaba is included will 
            Nasikabhooshani be heard.</o:p></strong></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal><strong><o:p><br>
            </o:p></strong><strong><o:p>For sheer musical excellence, composition 
            such as &quot;Enduku Peddala&quot; and &quot;Emi Nerama&quot;, both 
            in Sankarabharanam and &quot;Evarimata&quot; and &quot;Mari Mari Ninne&quot; 
            both in Khomboji and his large number of creations in thodi, in which 
            raga there are no fewer than 36 kritis, no two is alike and his ganaraga 
            pancharathnams cannot be excelled. The Kshetra kirtanas, the nalangu 
            songs for the soorthradhari (a sort of compere) to sing, the divyanama 
            kritis for ritualistic worship are all a treasure Swami has left for 
            us.</o:p></strong></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal><strong><o:p><br>
            </o:p></strong><strong><o:p>Swami was the first to introduce the desadi 
            thala and also to introduce sangatis in his connotations. The sangatis 
            were introduced to bring out the melodic and rhythmic intricacies, 
            the raga lakshanas and quite often, to bring out the purpose of the 
            song, e.g. Chetulara in Bhairavi and &quot;Thappi Brathiki Brova&quot; 
            in Todi, where all the sangatis are based on the words &quot;singaramu 
            jesi joothunu&quot; in the first case and &quot;brathiki brova tarama&quot; 
            in the second case. Kritis such as &quot;Dorakuna&quot; &quot;Mari 
            Mari Ninne&quot; &quot;O! Ranga Sayee&quot; &quot;Dharini Telusukonti&quot; 
            and others (numerous to list) are examples of sangatis used to create 
            an intrinsically and exquisitely conceived ornamentation of marvelous 
            musical architecture.</o:p></strong></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal><strong><o:p><br>
            </o:p></strong><strong><o:p>Sangeetha and Nada: Another example of 
            Sri Thyagaraja Swami's genius can be found in his handling of sangeetha 
            and nada. The study of sastras relating to sangeetha are supposedly 
            derived from divine sources and when used for devotional purposes, 
            could lead to the conferment of many blessings. There were clear texts 
            on the origin of our music, its structure and purposes.</o:p></strong></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal><strong><o:p><br>
            </o:p></strong><strong><o:p>The five octaves, madhya, mandaram, anumandara, 
            tara, and anutara were derived from the five forces of Shiva - Satyajata, 
            aghora, eesana, tatpurusha and vamadeva. The structured music is based 
            on the Sruthis, a unique concept and the purpose of music is only 
            one: to praise the Almighty. In other words, it is only devotion for 
            which sangeetha should be employed and not for any other purpose such 
            as mere artistic pleasure. These concepts are derived from the first 
            three slokas of Sangita Ratnakara.</o:p></strong></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal><strong><o:p><br>
            </o:p></strong><strong><o:p>In dealing with sangeetha or physical 
            aspects of music, Sri Thyagaraja Swami has taken the first three slokas 
            and composed the following three songs, almost word for word: 1. Naada 
            Thanumanisam Sankaram (Chittaranjani); 2. Sobhillu Sapthaswara (Jaganmohini); 
            and 3. Nadopasana (Begada). At this point, there is a clear distinction 
            made between sangeetha or the physical and aesthetic aspects from 
            nadopasana or the mystic, esoteric aspects or naada yoga. These are 
            discussed in the article on Nadopasana.</o:p></strong></p>
          <p class=MsoNormal><strong><o:p><br>
            </o:p></strong><strong><o:p>The practice of sangeetha, based on the 
            sastras , is referred to in &quot;Ananda Sagara&quot; (Garudadwani) 
            and &quot;Sangita Sastra Gnanamu&quot; (Muhari). As fruits of the 
            practice of sangeethopasana, mention is made of the &quot;Ocean of 
            Bliss - Sangeetha Sastramagu Brahmananda Sagara&quot; and again, mention 
            is made of other such fruits of nadopasana in the Mukhari kriti as 
            &quot;Prema bhakthi sujana vatsalya&quot; and &quot;Srimad Rama vara 
            katakshamu.&quot; In the kriti &quot;Sripapriya sangeethopasana seyave 
            O Manasa&quot;, he refers o the ragas which take pleasing forms. The 
            practice of the art of sangeetha will bring to its practitioner Sarropya 
            or attainment of good form; Galokya or being in the same realm as 
            God; Sarropya or being close to the Lord; Aroopya or attaining the 
            form of the ista devata and Sayjuya or merging with the god - the 
            forms of heavenly bliss. The origins of our music is divine, its structure 
            melodic and its purpose - the devout worship of God. Sri Thyagaraja 
            Swami, through his musical genius, brought us all these treasures.</o:p></strong></p>
