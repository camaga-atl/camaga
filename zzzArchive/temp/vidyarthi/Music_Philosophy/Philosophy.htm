    <td><p> <strong>Practically, every school of philosophy has claimed Swami 
        as its votary. Citing Swami's later day kritis such as Gnanamosoga rada 
        in Poorvikalyani and Paramatmudu in Vagadheeswari, the dvaitis claim him.&quot; 
        The Visishtaadvatis claim him citing kritis such as Bhuvini Dasudane in 
        Sriranjani, where the Sri Vedanta Desikan's Panchanga Prapatti is virtually 
        reproduced. The Marjara Nyaya school quote the Bhairavi kriti, Tananayuni 
        Brova to support of their claim. Sri Swami himself has been asked the 
        question, whether he follows one or the other margas; but, Swami, never 
        answered it. E dari sancharintura in Kanthamani and Dwaitamu Sukhama in 
        Riti Gowla clearly tell us that the answer to the question is not easy. 
        Indeed, he has clearly mentioned that the pathway to Godhead is a matter 
        of individual preference and the label is inconsequential. &quot;Vaga 
        Vadaja bujaiyinche variki tripthiaoureethi saguna dhyanamu paini sowkhyamu.&quot; 
        </strong></p>
      <p><strong>To Sri Thygaraja, labels and nomenclatures did not matter, as 
        by themselves, they matter little in helping the spiritual growth of man 
        and his endeavor to experience godhood. Like the satisfaction after a 
        meal is wholly an individual affair and no one meal being the cause of 
        universal satisfaction, philosophical path is a matter of personal choice 
        and preference. His main stress is on morals and ethics, humility and 
        non-attachment or un attachment or Thyaga.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>When Thyagaraja Swami interprets the puranas, he constantly emphasizes 
        that one has no right to be vain, selfish, and egoistic just because one 
        is learned in the scriptures or is in high status and power. One may possess 
        all the virtues in the world and yet be led only by selfishness and egoism, 
        ultimately losing all the benefits of the virtues he possesses as a gift 
        or boon from God. Take for example, Hiranya Kasipu and Ravaana who were 
        great tapasvans and had got boons for indestructibility. Yet, all their 
        power came to naught due to their wrong doings and they were annihilated. 
        Seetha, the Gopis, Narada, Durvasa, and others are mentioned as example 
        of those who sought and got boons but did not benefit from such boons. 
        However, thoughtfully and comprehensively received, unless one behaves, 
        God has a way of making that boon useless. God always gives a boon with 
        a hidden catch and while one may believe that I could do anything and 
        get away with it, one cannot. </strong></p>
      <p><strong>In &quot;Adigi Sukhamu&quot; (Madhyamavati), he stresses the 
        futility of asking for a boon and getting them in self-interest. (As Aldous 
        Huxley says &quot;Supplication&quot;) - where one asks God for something 
        and expressing gratitude by fulfilling a vow such as breaking coconuts 
        or other prasadams or monetary contributions as a quid pro quo. Instead, 
        one should surrender to the will of God and the faith and confidence that 
        God will bestow only what is good for us. In order that we may enjoy not 
        only the humor but the pithiness, let us look at a free translation of 
        Adigi sukhamulu. O! Rama! Who has benefited ultimately from your boons? 
        Sita had to to go the forest for having asked for a boon; Soorpanaka lost 
        her nose for just expressing her desires; Durvasa lost his appetite the 
        moment he asked for food; Devaki wanted you to be born her child and it 
        was Yasoda who had the good fortune of bringing you up. Narada became 
        a woman as soon as he asked for a boon; the Gopis desired you and lost 
        their husbands. What is this Maya? I shall hence surrender and leave it 
        to you to give me what is good for me. In Varalandu Kommani (Gujjari), 
        Swami asks rama, &quot;Why do you want to be cruel to me by conferring 
        boons? What have I done to deserve it? &quot;Like Nachiketas, neither 
        do I want nor would I accept anything less than liberation, moksha.&quot;</strong></p>
