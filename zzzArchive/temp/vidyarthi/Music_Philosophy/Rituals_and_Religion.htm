  <p><strong><font color="#0000FF" size="4">P. Sreenivasan and R. Krishnaswami</font></strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="left"><strong><font color="#666666" size="4" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Frequently 
    one hears the largely justified accusation that religion has failed to make 
    man, moral or compassionate and that, it has divided man from man. All religions 
    give us some code of ethics; of love of fellow human beings and all creatures. 
    Religion cannot be faulted if man has misinterpreted or misused religion to 
    serve his interest, at the cost of others. For that matter, politics and even 
    science have been abused and misused to serve selfish interests of men. Well, 
    this is not the subject under discussion now, though it is, we believe, not 
    an irrelevant digression.</font></strong></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong><font color="#666666" size="4">Thyagaraja 
    Swami stresses the point that for a true votary of any religion, there is 
    no division or isolation from the essentials. He stresses again and again, 
    &quot;bedharahita vedanthamu,&quot; &quot;matha bedhamuleka&quot; and &quot;dhaiva 
    bedhamuleka&quot; - all of them meaning that there should be no quarrel over 
    deities or denominations. In other words, the seeker after realization should 
    love god equally, devoutly, even when the deity is not the one he or his religion 
    proclaims as the supreme one. His advise to the seeker after salvation is 
    to find the ultimate through purity of thought, humility, compassion, and 
    love for all fellow human beings: and, all that is in one's environment.</font></strong></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong><font color="#666666" size="4">Among 
    several kritis in which he asks us to eschew bedhas, differences and differentiations, 
    we will cite only two here: &quot;Krupalavala&quot; in Nadhatarangini -- &quot;Aapavargapala 
    kamamulanu joochi addamai animadi siddhula mosapu chedarayya,&quot; - while 
    I seek only mosha, people around are putting stumbling blocks in the way by 
    trying to tempt me with ashtasiddhis and such other ersatz, the fake and the 
    spurious. In &quot;bhajana seyave (Kalyani), he addresses his own mind thus 
    (of course, it is really for lesser mortals like us): &quot;human birth endows 
    one with the capability to learn the significance and secret of naadha, pranava, 
    the seven swaras, the vedas, the mantras, sastras, puranas, etc., comprising 
    the 64 kalas. Why then should one seek pleasure and fulfilment in debates 
    and dialectics instead of seeking moksha - &quot; modakara sareeramethi mukthi 
    margamunu theliyani - vaadha tharkamela.&quot;</font></strong></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong><font color="#666666" size="4">This 
    emphasis on right, ethical conduct, egolessness, the pursuit of truth and 
    the need to give up purposeless learning, debate and discussion, occurs in 
    many other kritis among which we may cite some of the well known ones like 
    &quot;Manusunilpa Sakthileka pothe&quot; (Abhogi), &quot;Manasu Swadeenamaina 
    (Sankarabharanam) and &quot;Emijesithenemi.&quot; If space would permit, we 
    would have been happy to give a full and detailed translation of the entire 
    kritis; kritis which compel contemplation of the meaning for those who seek 
    the ultimate and are not interested in the divisions and spurious attractions 
    on the way to the goal. </font></strong></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong><font color="#666666" size="4">In 
    &quot;Emijesithenemi&quot; he says that, whatever one's learning, whatever 
    one's wealth and comforts, whatever the yagas one may have performed, though 
    one may be a great guru teaching esoteric mantras to others, such a one gains 
    nothing, at any rate not Salvation or Grace, unless one gives up kama, moha 
    (desire and elusion) and the like. In &quot;Manusunilpa&quot; and &quot;Manasu 
    Swadheenamaina&quot;, he says that irrespective of all and any qualifications, 
    it is the mind which is to be conquered, kept under control and check. In 
    the former - with some sarcasm, he asks, &quot;What is the use of doing pooja, 
    sounding the bell (for others to hear) if one cannot stop the mind (stop procession 
    of thoughts, images, and ideas as Sri Ramana Maharishi states), how does one 
    benefit by a bath in the Ganga or Cauvery if one has not erased the ego; what 
    is the use of thapas if one's mind is full of kama, krodha, etc. Will these 
    protect me?</font></strong></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong><font color="#666666" size="4">In 
    &quot;Manasu Swadeenamaina,&quot; he categorically states that nothing will 
    prevail one unless the mind is in control. In this song, he says that there 
    is no need for mantras and tantras for the man who has controlled and subdued 
    his mind; there is no need to do thapas for the man who has realized that 
    the body is not the self (dehatmabedha); there is no need to take to sanyasa 
    or adopt different ashramas at different times for the man who has realized 
    that God is everything (Vishishtadwaita: Saranagati and Prapatti); for the 
    man for whom there is no attraction of wealth or woman; for him who knows 
    that everything is blind illusion (impermanent; ephemeral); there is no need 
    for a man to worry about the future if he has taken care of the past and the 
    present through good conduct. Though Swami was well versed in the sastras 
    and puranas (or because of it, he could separate the essential from the inessential), 
    he lays greater emphasis on a simple, truthful, dharmic life and advises us 
    not to attach too much importance to rituals and ceremonies, differences, 
    distinction and debates, learning and preaching. The advise he has given can 
    be followed even by a simple minded, unlearned person, provided he seeks sincerely 
    and with steadfastness.</font></strong></font></p>
