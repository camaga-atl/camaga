<p>Sri T.V. Sankara narayanan (TVS), one of the leading vocalists
of carnatic music, was featured in a concert sponsored by The
Carnatic Music Association of Georgia (CAMAGA) and The Hindu
Temple of Atlanta, on Sunday, 6th September, 1998, at the Hindu
Temple of Atlanta. He was accompanied on the violin by Sri Delhi
P. Sundararajan, and on the mridangam by Sri Srimushnam Raja Rao.</p>

<p>I thought TVS once again came through with a high-quality
concert marked by excellent alignment with sruthi, a sarvalaghu
pattern of swara singing that was very pleasing to the ear,
obvious involvement and enthusiasm. I continue to be impressed by
TVS' ability to produce amazing sangathis seemingly with total
ease. I could see that the audience was enjoying every bit of his
swara singing. My favorite, however, was his neraval with
&quot;Kaalinil Chilambu Konja&quot; in the Todi piece. I thought
he brought forth the beauty of Todi splendidly here, and left me
savoring it by not singing swaras after that. For the viruttam,
he chose a composition by Atlanta's Dr. Venkateswaran, and sang
it with great involvement. TVS is also one of the few carnatic
vocalists who, in my opinion, are confident enough about their
vocal chords to hardly fuss about the mike settings.</p>

<p>In my opinion, Shri Sundararajan provided competent Violin
support. Shri RajaRao on the mridangam demonstrated a soft touch
and alignment with TVS' style of singing. Our laya expert, Dr.
Ram Sriram pointed out that Sri Raja Rao's transition in and out
of trisram in the tani avarthanam was superb.On the whole, I can
not sum up my impressions about this concert better than Smt.
Dharma Thiruvaiyaaru, who thanked the artistes at the end of the
program. She noted that we had wholesome music from an artiste
who always comes through for the audience.</p>
