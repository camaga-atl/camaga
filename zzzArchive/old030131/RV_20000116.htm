<h1 align="center"><u>Concert Review -- Madurai Sundar</u></h1>

<p align="center">(By Smt. Kalpana Rengarajan)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sri. Madurai R. Sundar gave an excellent concert on January 16th
, at the Hindu temple of Atlanta. This concert was organized by
the Carnatic Music Association of Georgia. <br>
<br>
Sundar opened the concert with Thodi varnam. This was followed by
the Bilahari piece &#147;Eka Dandam&#148; by Dikshithar. His
detailed alapana of &#147;Keeravani&#148; was excellent. The
neraval and swaras for the main piece in Keeravani &#147;Kaligi
Yunte&#148; by Thiagaraja was par excellence. He touched every
swarasthanam with great clarity and confidence even at the higher
octave.<br>
<br>
Though the concert was the day after Pongal, he sang a
Thiruppavai &#147;Thoomani Madathu&#148; in Hamir Kalyani and
another piece &#147;Thiruvadi Poorathil&#148; in Yaman Kalyani.
Both these songs were rendered with so much Bhava that it felt
like Andal herself was amidst us. In the ragamalika slokam &#147;Kanda
Kadirvela&#148;- the way &#147;Sahana &#147; was handled is
noteworthy. <br>
<br>
A key point in the success of this concert was the rapport
between Sundar and the accompanying artists- Sri.
Lakshminarayanan on the violin and Sri. Ram Sriram on the
Mridangam. The raga alapana on &#147;Sahana&#148; by
Lakshminarayanan deserves a special mention. Lakshminarayanan
matched Sundar very efficiently in the &#147;swara-ragamalika&#148;
section. Ram Sriram blended to Sundar&#146;s variations in all
aspects. He presented a neat and precise &#147;taniavarthanam&#148;.
<br>
<br>
Finally I would like to mention that none of the Raga alapanas
were overdone. Sundar&#146;s mix of nidhanam, diction and the
bhava of the songs in the right proportions gave the audience an
opportunity to listen to chaste Carnatic music. </p>
