<P><B>Why do I see this page?</B>
<P>When you enter http://people.atl.mediaone.net/camaga/ in your browser, MediaOne searches through a defined set of page names for the top page of that site.  The names it looks for are (in order): index.html, index.htm, default.html, default.htm, home.html and home.htm.  When you see this page, it means either that the top page of the site you are looking for is not named one of the above six names or that you have not yet published your Web site.

<P><B>How do I replace this page with the site I created?</B>
<P>To replace this page with your own Web site, you must name the top page of your new site index.html, index.htm, default.html, default.htm, home.html, or home.htm. Most software programs for creating Web pages will name your top page one of these six names automatically.  If the program you are using does not do this, you should save the top
page under one of these names yourself.

<P>After you publish your site, your newly created top page -- instead of this page -- will be accessed when visitors type in http://people.atl.mediaone.net/camaga/.

<P><B>Does it make any difference which of these six names I use for my top page?</B>

<P>Yes, it does. MediaOne Road Runner provides a gallery of user pages so that other MediaOne Road Runner users can visit your site. If you want your site to be listed in this gallery, the top page must be named <B><FONT COLOR="#000080">index.html</FONT></B>. If you do not wish to be included in the gallery, you should choose one of the other five names.

<P><B>Where can I go for more help on creating and publishing my Web site?</B>
<P>With MediaOne Road Runner Personal Pages, you can use any Web page authoring or 
  publishing software. We provide information and support for setting up and configuring 
  some of the most popular tools.
