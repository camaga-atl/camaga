<p>Review of Mrs. Savitri Ramanand's concert: Hosted by CMANA,
Atlanta on August 30, 1997. Review by Dr. Sury Sekar<br>
<br>
Rich Experience in Bhava-Laden Music<br>
<br>
Smt. Savithri Ramanand, the younger sister and student of the
popular duo, Bombay Sisters, enthralled carnatic music lovers<br>
in Atlanta with rich, bhava-laden music on Saturday, August 30,
at the Riverdale Hindu Temple.<br>
<br>
The concert was excellent in some critical dimensions - quality
of the voice, alignment with sruthi, selection of items,<br>
bhava, and rapport with the accompanying artistes. Smt. Savithri
exhibited a naturally melodious voice, and a very good<br>
alignment with sruthi, both of which, if not present, could
detract a lay rasika like me from enjoying the concert.<br>
<br>
She opened with a Varnam in Kedaragowlam, followed by the Nattai
piece &quot;Sri Mahaganapatim&quot; by Dikshithar. She then<br>
presented &quot;Mamava &quot; in Hindolam, and a composition of
Thiagaraja &quot;Evarikai&quot; in Devamruthavarshini. Next, she
elaborated<br>
Shankarabharanam in a way that was most satisfying to me,
aesthetically. She then sang the Papanasam Sivan piece<br>
&quot;Mahalakshmi.&quot;.<br>
<br>
She followed with a soulful rendition of the Dikshithar piece in
Sama, &quot;Annapurne&quot;. To me, the last two renditions were<br>
deeply rich in bhava, and very moving.<br>
<br>
I was quite impressed with her elaboration of Panthuvarali next,
and more so with the way she sang the Swathi Tirunal piece<br>
&quot;Sarasaksha&quot;. She chose a pace that enabled her to
produce sangathis that were novel, very impressive, and not at
all<br>
distracting. After the tani avarthanam, she sang some popular
selections, &quot;Venkatachala Nilayam&quot; in Sindhu Bhairavi,
the<br>
ragamalika &quot;Sri Chakra Raja&quot;, and the Yamuna Kalyani
piece &quot;Krishna Nee Begane&quot;. She followed with an
Annamachariar<br>
composition, and another on Lord Muruga, and I regret I did not
make a note of the Sahityam in these cases.<br>
<br>
A key contributor to the succeess of this concert was the overall
rapport between Smt. Savithri, and her accompanying<br>
artistes - Sri Lakshminarayanan on the Violin, Dr. Ram Sriram on
the Mridangam, and Sri Murali on the Kanjira. They coaxed<br>
their instruments to match the vocalist's voice modulations, and
collaborated extremely well with each other. I was<br>
especially impressed with the Panthuvarali of Sri
Lakshminarayanan, and the tani avarthanam of Dr. Sriram and Sri
Murali.<br>
<br>
The last words on this superb concert should go to some rasikas
whose comments to me were &quot;I felt like sitting in front of<br>
the deity she sang in praise of&quot;, &quot;her words are very
clear&quot;, and &quot;I was moved to tears on occasions&quot;.<br>
