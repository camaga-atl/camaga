The Great Composers Day was celebrated at The Hindu Temple of Atlanta on
Saturday, the 22nd of February 1997.  The purpose of the function was to
pay homage to Saint Thyagaraja, Sri Muthuswamy Dikshithar, and Sri Syama
Sastry,  three great composers of carnatic classical music, also referred
to as "The Trinity".  The all-day affair began a little before 9 a.m., with
the group-singing of Saint Thyagaraja's "Pancharatna Kritis".  These five
compositions are in the carnatic ragas Naattai, Gowlai, Aarabhi, Varaali,
and Sriraagam, respectively.  This was followed by individual singing of
the compositions of The Trinity.  The day ended at 7 p.m., following the
group-singing of Saint Thyagaraja's "Utsava Sampradaya Kritis",
compositions that are typically sung on special occasions like Bhajans and
Harikathas.

This year's celebration marks the continuation of an annual tradition in
Atlanta, that began in 1988.  Until 1995, this day was celebrated as
"Thyagaraja Aradhana", or homage to Saint Thyagaraja, one of the Trinity.
Its scope has now been expanded to include both Sri Dikshithar and Sri
Syama Sastry.  The featured artistes this year included singers from
Atlanta, Florida, Lousiana, and Athens, Georgia.  This very
well-organized event continues to serve as a great opportunity for carnatic
music lovers to get together and listen to both the veteran singers as well
as young and emerging talent.
