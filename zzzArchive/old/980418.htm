<p><font size="3">Sri Trichur Ramachandran gave what I thought
was a scintillating 3-1/2 hour<br>
concert at the Hindu Temple of Atlanta on the afternoon of
Saturday, April<br>
18. He was accompanied on the violin by Sri Chandramouli
(disciple of Sri<br>
V.V. Subramanian), and on the mridangam by Sri Umayalpuram Mali
(disciple<br>
of Sri Umayalpuram Sivaraman). This concert was organized by the
Carnatic<br>
Music Association of Georgia (CAMAGA) and the Hindu Temple of
Atlanta.<br>
The items presented were:<br>
<br>
1. Evari - Abhogi varnam- Adi<br>
2. Pranamamyakam - Gowlai - Adi- Mysore Vasudevachar<br>
3. Dinamani - Harikambodi - Adi -Thyagaraja<br>
4. Ninnera - Pantuvarali - Rupakam -Thyagaraja<br>

6. Parimala Ranganatham - Hameer Kalyani - Dikshithar<br>

14. Chittamayura - Des<br>

<br>
Sri Ramachandran opened briskly with the varnam, Pranamamyakam,
and<br>
Dinamani in quick succession, with short and very enjoyable
stretches of<br>
kalpana swaras. I immensely enjoyed his alapana of Pantuvarali
and Hameer<br>
Kalyani. I thought he did a very nice job by singing a rarely
heard<br>
Dikshithar composition in a slow and deliberate pace. The Ragam
Tanam<br>
Pallavi was a delight to the intellectual. A
&quot;technically&quot; sophisticated<br>
rasika like Dr. Ram Sriram felt that Dharmavati was very well
done, and<br>
that there was immense challenge in the talam (Kanda Nadai Adi).
In the<br>
ragamalika swaras, Sri Ramachandran chose ragas ending with the
term<br>
&quot;vati&quot; and introduced the name of the raga into the
pallavi on completion<br>
of the respective swara sequence. However, I felt that he was at
his best<br>
in the Narayaneeyam piece. I was particularly moved by his
rendition of<br>
Hamsanandhi. It was nice to observe the way Sri Ramachandran
seemed to<br>
enjoy his music, and his strong encouragement of his accompanying
artists.<br>
He diligently announced the raga, tala, composition and composer
after<br>
every item. I also thought that Sri Chandrmouli and Sri Mali met
very<br>
well the challenge of accompanying a senior accomplished
musician. Sri<br>
Mali contributed a neat and precise tani. Overall, I had an
immensely<br>
satisfying afternoon listening to chaste carnatic music.</font></p>
