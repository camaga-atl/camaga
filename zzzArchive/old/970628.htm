Hi music lovers,<br>
<br>
Recently Rajkumar Bharathi, (great grandson of Shri Mahakavi
Subrmanya<br>
Bharathiyaar), gave a superb performance at the Georgia Tech
auditorium<br>
here in Atlanta. His voice is so melodious and appealing.
Rajkumar<br>
Bharathi, rendered gem like compositions of his great
grandfather, with<br>
the same bhava that the poet must have had when composing the
songs. It<br>
was very inspiring and I am sure it would have made Bharathiyaar
very<br>
proud. His accompaniments Ravindran(mridangam) and
Subramanian(violin)<br>
were equally keeping up to the challenge,that the Jr. Bharatiyaar
had<br>
given them.<br>
<br>
Here is a list of the songs he rendered :<br>
<br>
1. Vanajakshi - Kalyani varnam<br>
2. Ganapthi Thaal Karuthinai vaippom - Naattai<br>
3. Vandhe maatharam enpom - Maya Malava Gowlai<br>
4. Endharo mahanu bavulu - Sri Ragam<br>
5. Ninnai chila varangal ketpen - Shanmugha priya (excellent song
and<br>
great selection of raagam)<br>
6. Baratha desam endru peyar solluvom - Ragamalika (reminding of<br>
&quot;Kappalottiya thamizhan&quot; )<br>
7. Kannan thiruvadi ennuka maname - Begada (this was a great one)<br>
8. Parukkullle nalla naadu - Desh<br>
9. Chinnanjiru kiliye - Mohana kalyani<br>
10. Hanumana mathave hariyemmathavo - Madhukauns<br>
11. Vellai thamarai poovil iruppaall - Abheri<br>
12. Bharatha samudhaayam<br>
<br>
On the whole it was a great concert. I had a great time and I am
sure ,<br>
so did others. If you need tapes of the concert, contact Dr. Ram
Sriram<br>
at rsriram@gsu.edu or (770) 493-6534 for further information.<br>
<br>
Bharathiyaar's compositions are indeed truly great and brings out<br>
bhakti, veeram, love, patriotism through them. Let's keep that
attitude<br>
and spirit alive in us all the time..<br>
<br>
Just another music lover like you...<br>
