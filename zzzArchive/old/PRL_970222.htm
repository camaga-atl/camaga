<p>The following is a press release sent to India Tribune
(~3/1/97) :</p>

<p>The Great Composers Day was celebrated at The Hindu Temple of
Atlanta on Saturday, the 22nd of February 1997. The purpose of
the function was to pay homage to Saint Thyagaraja, Sri
Muthuswamy Dikshithar, and Sri Syama Sastry, three great
composers of carnatic classical music, also referred to as
&quot;The Trinity&quot;. The all-day affair began a little before
9 a.m., with the group-singing of Saint Thyagaraja's
&quot;Pancharatna Kritis&quot;. These five compositions are in
the carnatic ragas Naattai, Gowlai, Aarabhi, Varaali, and
Sriraagam, respectively. This was followed by individual singing
of the compositions of The Trinity. The day ended at 7 p.m.,
following the group-singing of Saint Thyagaraja's &quot;Utsava
Sampradaya Kritis&quot;, compositions that are typically sung on
special occasions like Bhajans and Harikathas. This year's
celebration marks the continuation of an annual tradition in
Atlanta, that began in 1988. Until 1995, this day was celebrated
as &quot;Thyagaraja Aradhana&quot;, or homage to Saint
Thyagaraja, one of the Trinity. Its scope has now been expanded
to include both Sri Dikshithar and Sri Syama Sastry. The featured
artistes this year included singers from Atlanta, Florida,
Lousiana, and Athens, Georgia. This very well-organized event
continues to serve as a great opportunity for carnatic music
lovers to get together and listen to both the veteran singers as
well as young and emerging talent.
