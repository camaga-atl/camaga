the 'Padmashri' title conferred by the President of India and the<br>
'Sangeetha Kalanidhi' conferred by the Music Academy, Madras. He
has<br>
performed extensively in almost every corner of the world, being

make this a<br>
memorable experience for everyone in the audience.<br>

velvety in the low register and bright and sparkling in the top.<br>
