<p><font size="3">Sri Trichur Ramachandran gave what I thought
was a scintillating 3-1/2 hour concert at the Hindu Temple of
Atlanta on the afternoon of Saturday, April 18. He was
accompanied on the violin by Sri Chandramouli (disciple of Sri
V.V. Subramanian), and on the mridangam by Sri Umayalpuram Mali
(disciple of Sri Umayalpuram Sivaraman). This concert was
organized by the Carnatic Music Association of Georgia (CAMAGA)
and the Hindu Temple of Atlanta. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Sri Ramachandran opened briskly with the
varnam, Pranamamyaham, and Dinamani in quick succession, with
short and very enjoyable stretches of kalpana swaras. I immensely
enjoyed his alapana of Pantuvarali and Hameer Kalyani. I thought
he did a very nice job by singing a rarely heard Dikshithar
composition in a slow and deliberate pace. The
Ragam--Tanam--Pallavi was a delight to the intellectual. A
&quot;technically&quot; sophisticated rasika like Dr. Ram Sriram
felt that Dharmavati was very well done, and that there was
immense challenge in the talam (Kanda Nadai Adi). In the
ragamalika swaras, Sri Ramachandran chose ragas ending with the
term &quot;vati&quot; and introduced the name of the raga into
the pallavi on completion of the respective swara sequence.
However, I felt that he was at his best in the Narayaneeyam
piece. I was particularly moved by his rendition of Hamsanandhi.
It was nice to observe the way Sri Ramachandran seemed to enjoy
his music, and his strong encouragement of his accompanying
artists. He diligently announced the raga, tala, composition and
composer after every item. I also thought that Sri Chandrmouli
and Sri Mali met very well the challenge of accompanying a senior
accomplished musician. Sri Mali contributed a neat and precise
tani. Overall, I had an immensely satisfying afternoon listening
to chaste carnatic music.</font></p>
