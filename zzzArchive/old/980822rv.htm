<p>Smt. Lalgudi Rajyalakshmi enthralled the Atlanta carnatic music lovers with a
three-hour solo violin recital on Saturday, August 22, 1998, at The Hindu Temple of
Atlanta. She was accompanied on the mridangam by Dr. Ram Sriram,and on the kanjira by Shri
Murali Ramachandran.</p>

<p>This concert was organized by The Carnatic Music Association of Georgia (CAMAGA), and
supported by The Hindu Temple of Atlanta. Smt. Rajyalakshmi started the concert briskly
with a varnam composed by her brother Sri Lalgudi G. Jayaraman, in the ragam Bahudari. The
Dikshithar krithi &quot;Mahaganapathim&quot; in Naattai followed. Next, &quot;Baala
Kanakamaya&quot; in Atana was movingly rendered. &quot;Raara Maa Intidaaka&quot; (Asaveri)
followed next. She then briefly presented Begada, and rendered &quot;Sankari Neeve&quot;
of Sri Syama Sastri. Next was the Kalavathi kriti, Oka bari mata. After elaborating
Vaachaspati, she then played the Thyagaraja composition &quot;Kanta Choodumi&quot;. This
was followed by another Thyagaraja piece, &quot;Brochevarevarura&quot;(Khamas). The main
piece of the concert, &quot;Bhavanutha&quot; in Mohanam followed next. After the Tani
Avarthanam, she presented a very brief Bhairavi alapana, tanam, and elaborated a Mishra
Jhampe talam pallavi, with ragamalika swaras.</p>

<p>After the RTP, she presented the popular kritis, Venkatachala Nilayam(Sindhubhairavi),
Manasa Sancharare (Sama), Chinnanchiru Kiliye(Ragamalika), Jagadodharana (Kapi), and an
Annamacharya composition in Revati (Nanthi Bratuku). The concert ended with a thillana in
Desh composed by Shri Lalgudi G. Jayaraman.</p>

<p>I felt that Smt. Rajyalakshmi's kirtana renditions were at a leisurely pace,with very
good depth of tone and involvement, that helped preserve the beauty of the sahithya. To
me, her alapanas of Vachaspati and Mohanam were elegant, retaining the essentials of the
raga patterns. I was quite movedby her rendition of &quot;Manasa sancharare&quot;. I was
particulary impressed with the number of 1-cycle patterns she played in the kalpana swaras
of the Mohanam piece. I did wish that the Bhairavi were longer, but she obviously had time
constraints.</p>

<p>Dr. Ram Sriram was, in my view, his usual sensitive self. I have repeatedly felt that
his playing always accentuates the strong points of the main artiste. His soft touch made
for my thoroughly enjoyable listening experience. Shri Murali Ramachandran on the kanjira
is almost entirely self-taught on this instrument. To me, his playing this day showed how
he is steadily emerging as a seasoned percussionist in the Atlanta area. The two of them
combined for a very nice tani avarthanam. Overall, I thought what we were treated to this
Saturday afternoon was a very competently presented, time-tested cutcheri that was very
pleasing to the ear. </p>
