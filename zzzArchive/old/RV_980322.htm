<p>On Sunday, the 22nd of March, 1998, the Carnatic Music
Association of<br>
Georgia (CAMAGA) organized a veena concert by Smt. Rajeswari
Pariti,<br>
accompanied on the veena by her daughter Smt. Swati Dokka, and on
the<br>
mridangam by Dr. Ram Sriram, at the Hindu Temple of Atlanta in
Riverdale,<br>
Georgia.<br>
<br>
Smt. Pariti presented this concert in the traditional cutcheri
format. She<br>
opened with a varnam in Saveri, followed by &quot;Vatapi
Ganapatim&quot;, the<br>
Dikshithar piece in Hamsadhwani. She then rendered Saint
Thyagaraja's<br>
Pancharatna kriti &quot;Entaro&quot; in Sriragam. She followed
with two more<br>
compositions of Saint Thyagaraja - &quot;Banturithi&quot; in
Hamsanaadham and<br>
&quot;Nagumomu&quot; in Aabheri. Smt. Pariti then played an
alapana of Bhairavi, and<br>
followed it up with the Thyagaraja kriti &quot;Upacharamu&quot;.
Next was the Patnam<br>
Subrahmania Iyer composition in Kathanakuthookalam,
&quot;Raghuvamsa&quot;. Smt.<br>
Pariti then played a detailed ragam-tanam-pallavi in
Shanmukhapriya in Adi<br>
talam. The pieces that followed included &quot;Venkatachala
Nilayam&quot; in Sindhu<br>
Bhairavi, an Annamacharya composition in Behag, a Telugu folk
song, a piece<br>
in Punnagavarali, and a Sanskrit slokam.<br>
<br>
I felt that Smt. Pariti's playing was marked by adherence to
tradition. To<br>
me, her Bhairavi and Shanmukhapriya alapanas were chaste and<br>
well-structured. I found her playing of kalpana swaras to bring
out the<br>
beauty of the raga, without undue emphasis on complexity of the
patterns.<br>
In particular, I liked the way she did &quot;justice&quot; to the
ragam-tanam<br>
pallavi, developing the ragam and tanam in a deliberate and
methodical<br>
fashion.<br>
<br>
Dr. Ram Sriram, as he always does, enhanced my listening
experience<br>
considerably with his soft touch on the mridangam, emphasizing
naadam more<br>
than display of mathematical wizardry. In my view, he contibuted
a<br>
precise and well-structured tani avarthanam after the ragam tanam
pallavi.<br>
<br>
Overall, I found this concert to be a rewarding three-hour
musical<br>
experience on a Sunday afternoon.<br>
