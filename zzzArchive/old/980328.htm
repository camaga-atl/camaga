<p>Carnatic Instrumental (guitar) concert by Shri Prasanna -
Review of the concert by <a href="mailto:ks.sekar@mgt.gatech.edu">Dr.

<hr>

<p>The Carnatic Music Association of Georgia (CAMAGA) organized a
carnatic<br>
instrumental (guitar) concert by Shri Prasanna, at the Hindu
Temple of<br>
Atlanta at Riverdale, Georgia, on Saturday, March 28, 1998. Shri
Prasanna<br>
was accompanied on the mridangam by Shri Poovalur Srinivasan, and
on the<br>
kanjira by Shri Murali Ramachandran of Atlanta.<br>
<br>
Shri Prasanna commenced the concert with a varnam in ragam Behag,
and<br>
concluded with a rendition of the Note popularized by Madurai
Mani Iyer.<br>
The other items presented included Thyagaraja's &quot;Sangeetha
Gnanamu&quot; in<br>
Dhanyasi, and &quot;Chakkaniraja&quot; in Karaharapriya, and
Papanasam Sivan's<br>
&quot;Kapali&quot; in Mohanam, a composition of Shri G.N.
Balasubramanian in<br>
Nalinakanthi, and the popular &quot;Krishna Nee Begane&quot; in
Yamuna Kalyani, and<br>
&quot;Enna Thavam Seithanai&quot; in Kapi.<br>
<br>
It seemed to me that Shri Prasanna showed considerable mastery
over the<br>
guitar, and was able to coax gamakas out of this western
instrument. I<br>
thought his alapanas of Dhanyasi, Karaharapriya, and Mohanam were
handled<br>
competently. I also felt that his expertise in the western music
systems<br>
like jazz appeared to influence his renditions of the carnatic<br>
compositions, especially when he played the kalpana swaras, and
again when<br>
he played the Note. This was one of the two aspects of this
concert that I<br>
found interesting. The other was the significant amount of time
Shri<br>
Prasanna devoted to engaging the audience in a Question-Answer
session<br>
involving the instrument, his playing, his exposure to multiple
systems<br>
of music, etc.<br>
<br>
I felt that the percussion support in this concert was of a very
high<br>
order. I thought Shri Poovalur Srinivasan adjusted to Shri
Prasanna's<br>
playing style admirably. In addition, I felt the music from the
&quot;thoppi&quot;<br>
of his mridangam was very good, and that he played a very nice
&quot;tani&quot;. For<br>
someone who was playing his first major professional platform
concert, and<br>
who was paired with a very skillful and exuberant mridangist, I
felt Shri<br>
Murali on the kanjira rose to the occasion admirably, and was
able to hold<br>
his own during the &quot;tani&quot;.<br>
<br>
On the whole, I felt this was a different and an interesting
carnatic music<br>
recital.</p>
