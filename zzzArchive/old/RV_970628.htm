<p>Recently Rajkumar Bharathi, (the great grandson of Shri
Mahakavi Subrmanya Bharathiyaar), gave a superb performance at
the Georgia Tech Students Cenrer auditorium in Atlanta. His voice
is so melodious and appealing. Rajkumar Bharathi, rendered gem
like compositions of his great grandfather, with the same bhava
that the poet must have had when composing the songs. It was very
inspiring and I am sure it would have made Bharathiyaar very
proud.</p>

<p>His accompaniments Sri Prapancham Ravindran (mridangam) and
Sri Madhurai BalaSubramanian (violin) were equally keeping up to
the challenge, that the Jr. Bharatiyaar had given them.</p>

<p>Here is the list of the songs he rendered :</p>

<ol>
    <li>Vanajakshiro&nbsp;-- Kalyani varnam -- Adi - </li>
    <li>Ganapthi Thaal Karuthinai vaippom -- Naattai -- Adi --
        Subramanya Bharathi</li>
    <li>Vandhe maatharam enpom -- Maya Malava Gowlai -- Adi --
        Subramanya Bharathi</li>
    <li>Endharo mahanubhavulu -- Sri -- Adi - Thyagaraja</li>
    <li>Ninnai chila varangal ketpen -- Shanmukha priya -- Adi -
        Subramanya Bharathi (excellent song and great selection
        of raagam)</li>
    <li>Baratha desam endru peyar solluvom - Ragamalika --
        Subramanya Bharathi (reminding of &quot;Kappalottiya
        thamizhan&quot; )</li>
    <li>Kannan thiruvadi ennuka maname - Begada -- Adi
        --Subramanya Bharathi (this was a great one)</li>
    <li>Parukkullle nalla naadu - Desh - Adi - Subramanya
        Bharathi</li>
    <li>Chinnanjiru kiliye -- Ragamalika - Adi (Thrisra Gati) -
        Subramanya Bharathi</li>
    <li>Hanumana mathave -- Sumanesa Ranjani (Madhukauns) -- Adi
        -- Purandara Dasaru</li>
    <li>Vellai thamarai poovil iruppaall - Abheri -- Adi --
        Subramanya Bharathi</li>
    <li>Bharatha samudhaayam -- Behag -- Adi -- Subramanya
        Bharathi</li>
    <li>Mangalam -- Madhyamavathi -- Subramanya Bharathi</li>
</ol>

<p>On the whole it was a great concert. I had a great time and I
am sure , so did others. If you need tapes of the concert,
contact Dr. Ram Sriram at rsriram@gsu.edu or (770) 493-6534 for
further information.</p>

<p>Bharathiyaar's compositions are indeed truly great and brings
out bhakti, veeram, love, patriotism through them. Let's keep
that attitude and spirit alive in us all the time..</p>
