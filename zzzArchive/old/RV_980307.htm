<p>The carnatic music lovers of Atlanta and neighbouring areas
celebrated the tenth anniversary of the Great Composers Day on
Saturday, March 7, 1998, at the Hindu Temple of Atlanta in
Riverdale, Georgia.&nbsp; This day honors three great composers
of carnatic music - the &quot;Trinity&quot; of Thyagaraja,
Muthuswamy Dikshithar, and Shyama Sastri. </p>

<p>The day began at 9 a.m., with the group-singing of
Thyagaraja's Pancharatna kirtanas in the ragas Naattai, Gowlai,
Arabhi, Varali and Sriragam.&nbsp; This was followed by the
singing of the Trinity's compositions by young students of
carnatic music in the Atlanta area.&nbsp; After a 30-minute lunch
break, the day continued with individual singing by adults. </p>

<p>A unique feature this year was a 45-minute presentation each
by two senior musicians living in the US - Srimathi Janani
Prabhakaran of Baton Rouge, Lousiana, and Srimathi Manjula Ramesh
of Raleigh, North Carolina.&nbsp; They were accompanied on the
violin by Shri Lakshminarayanan of Miami, Florida, and on the
mridangam by Dr. Ram Sriram of Atlanta. </p>

<p>The very successful day concluded a little before 8 p.m.,
after the group-singing of Thyagaraja's Utsava Sampradaya
kirtanas. </p>

<p>This day also marked the formal launching of CAMAGA - the
Carnatic Music Association of Georgia.&nbsp; The response to the
preliminary call for membership in this organization was very
good, and it was announced that the &quot;concert season&quot; in
Atlanta would begin with the Great Composers Day each year.&nbsp;
Thanks to the enthusiasm and support of carnatic music lovers not
only in the Greater Atlanta Metro Area, but also from Athens and
Augusta, Georgia, and from the nearby states of Alabama, Florida,
Tennessee, North and South Carolinas, and Louisiana, as well as
the encouragement and support from The Hindu Temple of Atlanta,
this event is growing in success from one year to the next.</p>
