				<h3>A Short Biography of Thyagaraja Swami</h3>
				<address class="author">P. Sreenivasan</address>
			</header>

			<p>
				This short bio is only for the benefit of those not familiar with the details
				 of Thyagaraja Swami's life story. He was born on the 4th of May 1767 and died 
				 on January 7th, 1847. Thanks to our imprecise recording of history, there is 
				 doubt about the place in wich he was born. Most people believe he was born in 
				 Thiruvaroor. But, one foreign student of Swami doubts this. He points out that 
				 it is the custom to name the first born of the family after the preciding deity 
				 of the place and if Thyagaraja was indeed been born in Thiruvaroor the eldest son, 
				 Panchapakesan, would have been named Thyagaraja. It is also pointed out that Ramanathapuram
				Srinivasa Iyengar has in his song in praise of Swami says that he was born in Thiruvayyar. 
				We shall however have to leave it there for now.
			</p>
			<p>
				Thyagaraja Swami had two brothers. Swami's father, Sri Ramabrahmam,
				trained Swami in ritual worship and taught him the sastras and puranas.
				Pothana's Bhagavatham was one of the granthas used for daily parayanam.
				For a short time, Swami learnt music under the court musician Sonti
				Venkatasubbiah and his son, Sonti Venkatramanayya. No direct descendants
				of the Swami are now alive. He married twice and had one daughter who
				died issueless. Both on the father's side and mother's side, there were
				welll known musicians and Vidwants and it is said that from his
				grandfather, Giri Raja Kavi, he aquired rare musical treatise, such as
				the Sangeetha Ratnakara, the Sangraha Choodamani, and the mythical
				Swararnavam (distinct from the book of that name now available).
			</p>
			<p>
				There are many legends which attribute quite a few miracles as having
				been performed by Swami. Such legends are naturally interpolated, at
				least some of them apocryphical, added over the years but do have their
				use in presenting an interesting life story of a great individual. It is
				not this aspect which is of interest to us now. What he preached is what
				he practiced, i.e., eschewing the emotional and character weaknesses -
				Kama, kroda, lobha, moha, mada, and matsarya - but, practicing sama,
				dama, uparati, titiksha, saraddha, and samadana. In other words, he
				showed us that we must get rid of desire, lust, selfishness, ego,
				jealousy, hatred, and fear and cultivate self control, equanimity,
				tranquility, ability to bear suffering and look away from evil. Hence,
				what we should remember and base ourselves on, are his streadfast
				determination to stick to the path of truth and virture for "their" own
				sake and not for fame, comfort, and vanity.

				<h3>Utsava Sampradaya Kritis</h3>
				<address class="author">P. Sreenivasan</address>
			</header>
			
			<p>
				As the term "Utsava Sampradaya" indicates, these are songs to aid
				ritualistic worship. In every Hindu temple, a daily program of rituals
				is followed by singing to the deity; beginning with "waking Him up; for
				blessing the world; and, ending with letting his rest at night", after
				which the temple is closed. Every temple has a "massotsava" or some
				minor celebration on occassions like Poornima (full moon), pakshotsava
				or fortnightly festival like Pradhosha and samvatsarotsava or annual
				festival like the Bharmotsvam and Rathotsavam, etc. In simple by lilting
				and captivating tunes, the Utsava Sampradaya Keertanas provide
				"upachara" from "melukolpu" or awakening the Lord (Thirupalli Ezhuchi";
				inviting the Lord to come to the Kolumantapa; to ascend the steps to the
				accompaniment of Veena, "Hetsarika"; to announce that the Lord is in
				Kolu or Darbar and that all devotees may come and workship - Kalayanam,
				Nalangu, Oonjal, Aarthi, Pavvali and Melukoluppu.
			</p>	
			<p>
				Arranged in this natural and proper order and, sung with devotion,
				these songs can provide a means of elevating oneself to a suprapersonal
				level: sangeetha and bhaktha have again and again been stressed as the
				easiest means of salvation, for one who has no time for complex
				tirualistic worship. Singing all the important upachara songs takes a
				little over an hour and, if one can do this at least on every Bahula
				Panchami day or during Pushna nakshatra (the Sain't birth star), he is
				bound to experience the beneficial results as time goes on.

				<h3>Thyagaraja's Views on Ego and Rituals</h3>
				<address class="author">Dr. R. Krishnaswamy and Ram Sriram</address>
			</header>
			<p>
				Like most other saints and sages, Thygaraja Swami tells us that it is
				primarily the mind that one must ame so that its full potential raises
				one ultimately to a Supra-personal level. In every one of us, both God
				and the devil reside - the devil is the "ego", self-centerdness,
				selfishness, etc As Schopenhauer said, "If you are looking for God
				outside yourself, you are wasting your time and attempting the
				impossible. And, Jalaludin Rami says that if one wanted to see the devil
				one has only to look at a mirror! Therefore, to cconquer the mind and to
				direct it inwards is the purpose of most rituals. For example, upavasa
				or fasting was prescribed to learn to resist the temptation of
				apparently unbearable hunger; ekantha or solitude was prescribed to
				train the mind to resist descending to subhuman emotions, through
				avoiding the company of "paamara chelimi" - the ignorant and the wicked
				- and, "vana vaasa" was prescribed for the same reason; for
				strengthening of the mind and train us in detachment from desires and
				bondage.
			</p>
			<p>

				While speaking of rituals meant for our progress, Thyagaraja Swami also
				emphasizes that if these rituals become just a matter of routine,
				without aiming at the purpose for which they are meant, we will be no
				better than the goat that lives merely on the leaves or a highway robber
				who lives in caves or, the monkey which lives in forests and eats
				fruits. Living in a forest alone or in seclusion do not make us a saint
				or a sage. These, telling examples are from the kriti, "Balamu Kulamu"
				(Saveri). In this kriti, he further points out that mere rituals are
				purposeless, however meticuluously performed they may be. Devotion and
				earnestness are the sine quo non of the path to salvation.
			</p>	
			<p>
				There are also other illustrations in his kritis, some even humorous.
				(1) "Neeta kaaki meenu munuga niratha mudaya snanama" - the crow and the
				fish bathe in the water very early, but does that mean that it is taking
				udaya snanamu? (2) the kokku (Stork or the Crane) closes its eyes and
				stands near the water for hours. Does this mean that it is in
				meditation? Thus, it is not empty rituals alone that are important but,
				more importantly, devotion, sincerity, and humility behind the
				performance of a ritual.*
			</p>
			<p>
				Another important precept of the Swami is that egotism and selfishness
				form the curtain inside us, preventing realization and godliness. Here,
				I may refer to the anecdote on his visit to Thirumala. The usual pracice
				in Thirumala, as most of us know, requires that the Sannadhi is closed
				at specific hours. At this time, public "darshan" is not allowed. It is
				said that when the Saint visited Thirumala hills to have darshan of the
				Lord, Thyagaraja, notwithstanding his advanced age and infirmity,
				climbed the hills fairly quickly. This, it is said, created a feeling of
				self satisfaction and pride in him. When he got to the Sannadhi, he
				found to his disappointment and frustration, that the curtain denied him
				the darshan of Lord Venkateshwara. He immediately realized that what he
				wanted to see as a vigraha in front of him was not outside him but
				within him which he failed to see mentally and spiritually because of
				vanity and pride. Harikatha story tellers say that when Thygaraja swami
				sang the Gowlipanthu kriti, "Theratheeyakaradha", the curtain fell; thus
				allowing him full darshan of the Lord. However, a study of the text of
				the kriti will show that the curtain he refers to is not the one that
				stood between him and the vigraha of the Lord, but his own feeling of
				"I", "me" and "mine".
			</p>	
			<p>
				Stories are also told that Thyagaraja lamenting the loss of his idols
				of Sri Rama, asking where have you gone hiding in the song "Endu
				Dakkinado" (Thodi); and, in another episode, singing "Mundhu venuka"
				(Darbar) when his palanquin was waylaid in the Nagalapuram forest by the
				robbers, on his way back from Kovur. Here again, a study of the text
				will show that the song has other meaning than those reading them.
				Thyagaraja pleads to Rama to come soon and save him from bondage and
				misery and not necessarily save him from the robbers.
